# Project Title: Groq API Chat Assistant

## Description:
This project utilizes the Groq API to create a chat assistant that can generate responses to user queries or prompts. The chat assistant leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide informative and contextually relevant answers, making it useful for various applications such as customer support, information retrieval, and conversational interfaces.

## Installation:
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the `groq` library using pip:
    ```bash
    !pip install -q groq
    ```

## Getting Started:
To get started with the basic example, follow these steps:
1. Import the necessary libraries and modules.
2. Initialize the Groq client with your API key.
3. Create a chat completion request with a user message.
4. Print the response generated by the chat assistant.

```python
from groq import Groq
from google.colab import userdata

# Initialize Groq client
client = Groq(api_key=userdata.get('GROQ_API_KEY'))

# Create a chat completion request
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.",
        }
    ],
    model="mixtral-8x7b-32768",
)

# Print the response
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
